Figure 1 illustrates this concept by showing the annual abundances of hares tagged in Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest from 1998-2012. Populations were high in 1999 (nearly 400 hares tagged), but decreased drastically to a low of 29 in 2002. Following this low, the population gradually increased even higher - by 2009, there were 439 hares taggged.\n# Use ggplot to create a graph showing changes in annual abundance ggplot(data = yearly_timeline) + # use data frame from previous tab geom_path(aes(x = year, y = count), color = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;)+ scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1998, 2012), # set limits to x and y axis breaks = c(1998:2012), expand = c(0,.5)) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 500), expand = c(0,0))+ labs( # add reader-friendly labels y = \u0026quot;Number of hares trapped\u0026quot;, x = \u0026quot;year\u0026quot;) + theme_classic() # simple theme Figure 3.

Habitat loss and fragmentation are among the biggest threats to these fragile populations, which require particular temperatures and levels of moisture to survive3. Clear-cut logging, in particular, has been shown to increase sedimentation in streams, which negatively impacts larval amphibians3. Monitoring efforts have been implemented to assess how activities like clear-cutting affect salmonid populations, including the Aquatic Vertebrate Population Study within the H.J. Andrews Forest Long Term Ecological Research Program (HJA LTER), which monitors the threatened Pacific giant salamander (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) among other species. Here, we examine the distribution of Pacific giant salamanders in a section of forest that was clear-cut for logging in 1963 compared to a nearby 500 year old coniferous forest in Mack Creek, Oregon. Restoration efforts are sometimes used to attempt to convert habitats from a degraded state back to their pre-disturbance condition, typically by creating pools or increasing habitat complexity4. Understanding how the distribution of Pacific giant salamanders changes in different habitats can help guide restoration efforts.\nFigure 1. Pacific giant salamander, Dicamptodon tenebrosus.

Provided by YouTube user: MFWestphal (source)\n Data and Methods As part of an effort to monitor population trends of aquatic vertebrates in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, data on annual abundances, weights, forest section location, and habitat preferences of the Pacific giant salamander have been collected by researchers with the Andrews Forest Long Term Ecological research site since 19935. Mack Creek runs through sections of both old growth and historically clear-cut forest and provides three primary types of habitat for aquatic organisms (pools, side-channels, and cascades). 150m stretches of the creek are divided into contiguous 50m sections, which were netted at each end. Observations for aquatic vertebrates were acquired via two-pass electrofishing, followed by subsequent measurement of body dimensions and weight for all captured individuals.\nWe compared annual abundances since 1993, and habitat preferences and weight differences in 2017 for Pacific giant salamanders in old growth and clear cut sections of forest. We used a Chi-square test to assess salamander habitat preferences within forest sections, a two-sample t-test test to compare mean weights by forest section, and a one-way ANOVA to compare mean weights of salamanders across the three primary habitat types. For all statistical tests, we used a significance level of \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05. All data preparation and analyses were completed using R software (version 3.6.1) and RStudio (version 1.2.5001).\nFigure 3. Map of H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest with associated streams. Streams are depicted as blue lines and sample locations as green circles. This report focuses on salamanders found in Mack Creek. Picture credit: Sashka Warner. (source)\n  Results Pacific giant salamander abundance over time Trends in Pacific giant salamander abundance were compared for the clear cut and old growth sections of Mack Creek from 1993 to 2017 (Figure 4). Throughout 1993-2017, Pacifc giant salamander abundances observed in sections of old growth forest were consistently higher than in historically clear-cut sections, with exceptions to this trend in 1994 and 2014-2017. Both populations show a marked increase in abundance following 2001 and 2014, as well as a sharp decline in 2011. Overall, populations of salamanders increased from 1993 to 2017 by 154% in the old growth section, and 192% in the clear cut section.\nFigure 4. Annual abundances of the Pacific giant salamander in two standard reaches of Mack Creek in the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest from 1993 -2017. Salamanders were counted in a reach running through a section of old growth forest (blue line) and a section of historically clear-cut forest (red line).\n Salamander habitat preference within old growth vs clear cut forest sections   Table 1: Proportions of giant salamanders in different channel classifications observed in two sections of Mack Creek      Clear Cut  Old Growth      Cascade  247 (67.1%)  201 (62.8%)    Pool  31 (8.4%)  45 (14.1%)    Side-Channel  90 (24.5%)  74 (23.1%)     Channels that make up Pacific giant salamander habitat are often classified into three different areas: cascades, pools, and side channels. Proportions of salamanders in each channel classification were compared for the old growth and clear cut sections of Mack Creek (Table 1).\nThere is not a significant effect of forest section (old growth or clear cut) on where salamanders are found in the channel (\\(\\chi\\)2(2) = 5.54, p = 0.06). There are similar proportions of salamanders found in each of the three channel classifications in both the clear-cut and old growth sections of forest (Table 1).\n Comparison of salamander weight by forest section and channel classification In addition to abundance, examining salamander weight can yield more information about the size distribution of the populations in the different forest sections and channel classifications.\nThere was no significant difference in mean salamander weight in 2017 for the old growth compared to the clear cut section of forest (two sample t-test, t(692.79) = -1.67, p = 0.096). Thus, weight information was combined for the two sections to examine size distributions across the diffferent channel classifications (Figure 5).\nFigure 5.  Distributions for Giant Pacific Salamander mass (g) are displayed (violins) for habitat type, pooled for old growth and clear cut sections of forest. Mean masses (black dots) \\(\\pm\\) standard error (error bars) are displayed for each habitat type.\nMean weights of Pacific giant salamanders did differ significantly between pools and side channels (one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey’s HSD: F\\(_{2,684}\\) = 4.22, p = 0.015). Mean weights for individuals from cascades did not differ significantly from the other two habitat types (Figure 5). The average weight for populations residing in pools (9.3 \\(\\pm\\) 1.56 g) was 63.79% more than that of populations observed in side-channels (5.68 \\(\\pm\\) 0.65 g). Due to large within group variation of salamander weights in each habitat type, an alternative metric – population medians, for instance – may lend to a more meaningful and accurate comparison across these groups. This could be achieved by using a rank-based test, such as a Mann-Whitney U test.\n  Summary  From 1993-2017, overall Pacific giant salamander abundances increased in both old growth and historically clear cut sections of forest, by 154% and 192% respectively (Figure 4). Forest section (old growth vs clear cut) did not significantly affect the habitat type (pool, cascade, or side-channel) in which salamnders were found (Table 1). There is no significant difference in mean salamander weight in 2017 for the old growth compared to the clear cut section of forest. In 2017, the mean weight of salamanders residing in pools was significantly greater than that of populations in side channels (Figure 5).

Monitoring efforts have been implemented to assess the effectiveness of these MPAs by comparing population characteristics of species inside and outside of the protected areas2. One such effort, undertaken by the Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research (SBC LTER) program, conducts yearly monitoring of kelp forest species in the Santa Barbara Channel inside and outside of MPAs. Within the Santa Barbara Channel, the California Spiny Lobster (Panulirus interruptus) is currently a species of interest, as it provides a lucrative fishery but also serves an important role in maintaining kelp forest ecosystems through predation of sea urchins3. Without predatory regulation, sea urchins can reach abundances high enough to decimate kelp populations and induce unfavorable ecosystem shifts from kelp forests to urchin barrens4. Excessive fishing of other species of lobster has been implicated in causing subsequent overgrazing of macroalgal communities by sea urchins5, 6. Here, we assess impacts of fishing pressure on population characteristics of the California Spiny lobster from 2012-2018.\nFigure 1: California Spiny Lobster, Panulirus interruptus. Photographer: Joel Sartore, National Geographic Photographer (source)\n  Data and methods Data for California spiny lobster abundance and size were collected and provided by researchers with the Santa Barbara Coastal Long-Term Ecological Research Program (SBC LTER)7. Divers collected annual estimates from 2012-2018 at five long-term kelp forest sites. Two sites (Naples and Isla Vista) are located in designated MPAs, which were created on 2012-01-01. The other three sites (Mohawk Reef, Carpinteria, and Arroyo Quemado) are located in unprotected areas. Estimates were collected annually in late summer, before the start of the fishing season, by counting lobsters to quantify abundance and visually estimating the carapace length (mm) for size information across a 40-meter transect at the five sites.\nChanges in annual lobster abundance over time were examined for each site by comparing the total lobster count for each year from 2012-2018. Size distributions were examined by comparing the size composition (mm) of the lobsters measured at each site in 2012 and in 2018. Mean lobster size was compared for lobsters measured in MPAs versus unprotected waters in 2012 and in 2018 using two-sample t-tests (\\(\\alpha\\) = 0.5 throughout). For more information on site and data collection methods, see metadata.\nAll data preparation and analyses were completed using R software (version 3.6.1) and RStudio (version 1.2.5001).\n Results Trends in annual lobster abundance following MPA creation in 2012 The Isla Vista and Naples sites were declared MPAs in 2012, effectively eliminating fishing pressure for spiny lobsters in those areas. The trends in total annual lobster abundance for those two sites, as well as the three other unprotected sites, were compared for 2012-2018 (Fig. 2).\nFigure 2. Total annual abundance of CA spiny lobsters for 5 sites in the Santa Barbara Channel from 2012 to 2018. Solid lines indicate sites within marine protected areas (Isla Vista and Naples) and dashed lines indicate sites in unprotected areas (Carpinteria, Mohawk, and Arroyo Quemado).\nAll sites have similar annual lobster abundance in 2012 and show an overall increase by 2018, but the two sites in Marine Protected Areas (Isla Vista and Naples) show a much greater increase than the sites in unprotected areas (Arroyo Quemado, Carpinteria, and Mohawk). From 2012 to 2018, annual lobster abundance at the Isla Vista and Naples sites increased by 3538% and 4866%, respectively. Percent increases in annual abundance were much smaller at the unprotected sites: though Carpinteria showed a drastic increase from 2015-2017, the overall increase in annual abundance was an order of magnitude smaller than the MPA sites (339%), and the other unprotected sites had even smaller changes at 42% and 98% (Arroyo Quemado and Mohawk, respectively).\n Shifts in lobster size distributions from 2012 to 2018 Figure 3. Size distributions of the California Spiny Lobster at 5 sites in the Santa Barbara Channel (Naples and Isla Vista = within MPA; Mohawk, Arroyo Quemado, and Carpinteria = outside of MPA) in 2012 (red) and 2018 (blue). Sizes are measured as carapace length in mm.\nBoth sites within MPAs (Naples and Isla Vista) showed increases in lobster size distribution from 2012 to 2018 (Fig. 3). Size distributions of lobsters in the non-MPA sites (Mohawk reef, Carpinteria, and Arroyo Quemado) appear relatively similar in both 2012 and 2018.\n Statistical comparisons for CA spiny lobster monitoring efforts Immediately following establishment of the MPAs in 2012, mean lobster size at sites inside MPAs was significantly different from that observed for lobsters in unprotected waters (two-sample t-test, t(42.09) = -3.25, p = 0.002), with lobsters measured inside MPAs roughly 10% smaller (Table 1). By 2018, mean lobster size inside MPAs still differed significantly from unprotected waters (two-sample t-test, t(1239.51) = 7.31, p \u0026lt; 0.001), however it was roughly 5% greater in the MPA sites.\nLobster size inside MPA sites increased significantly by an average of 15% from 2012 to 2018 (two-sample t-test, t(32.5) = -4.69, p \u0026lt; 0.001)), while lobsters observed outside of MPAs showed a marginal non-significant decrease in mean size over the same time period (two-sample t-test, t(296.01) = 1.33, p = 0.18).\nTable 1.

They are the same species as freshwater rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), but exhibit the salmon-esque behavior of swimming upstream from the ocean to spawn in the rivers where they were born. Interestingly, some even return back to the ocean after spawning - something salmon don’t even do! Monitoring populations of these special fish is important as they face increased threats due to climate change.

They are the same species as freshwater rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), but exhibit the salmon-esque behavior of swimming upstream from the ocean to spawn in the rivers where they were born. Interestingly, some even return back to the ocean after spawning - something salmon don’t even do! Monitoring populations of these special fish is important as they face increased threats due to climate change.","tags":null,"title":"Using time series data to explore steelhead passage across the Bonneville Dam","type":"project"}]
